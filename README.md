# Fans of Griff - Griff Tracker (CS 191 Capstone Project)

Joe Barnard, Maddie Backhaus, Maddie McEarlean, Sam Solheim


## Project Description:

Using Python, AWS, and HTML, our group is creating a website tracking a Tile Mate tracker to hypothetically track our live mascot, Griff II, when he visits Drake University's campus.

## Methodology & Scope:
    
-   Using the pytile API, we will build a Flask app hosted by Amazon Web Services
    
-   The website will have an embedded Google Maps view of Drake’s campus, with the location of Griff II drawn on top.
    
-   Our system will be self-sufficient and should not require any interaction by Griff II's handler once it is set up.
    
-   We will ignore or turn off the location data coming from pytile as soon as the tracker leaves Drake’s campus and surrounding area.
    

## Anticipated Deliverables:

-   We will launch a web page where users see a map of Drake University and its surrounding area, an Agenda overview of the calendar, a full Calendar page, and an Email Notification system.
    
-   When Griff II is on campus, his location will be displayed on the map. When he is off campus, location data will not be available.
    
-   Users will be able to set up email notifications when Griff is found to be on campus.
